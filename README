A simple script that take as input a dictionary file and a directory. It then changes the filenames in the
directory according to the dictionary file. Structure of dictionary files:
i->I
yh->th
ואכ->utf
...

Why this is useful? Well first of all, when you want to move files named with Unicode characters
to a file system that doesn't support unicode, you can transliterate the letters.

Usage:
DictionaryRenamer <dictionary_file> <dir_to_rename_file_in>
